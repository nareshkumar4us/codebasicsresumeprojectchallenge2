# Codebasicsresumeprojectchallenge2

As a data analyst,I have created a report by using POWER BI on Atliq Mart’s Supply Chain domain (FMCG) problem statement as part of Codebasics resume challenge2

**Problem Statement:**
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next 2 years. AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend the annual contract due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues. The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘on-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’ and OnTime in full (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

**Terminologies used:**

IF% - In Full Delivery
OT% - On-Time Delivery
OTIF% - On Time In Full Delivery
LIFR% - Line Fill Rate
VOFR% - Volume Fill Rate

**Worked on the following tasks,**

1.Connecting to source and importing data into POWER BI
2.Data Modelling in Power BI
3.Data Preprocessing by using Power Query Editor
4.Creating Measures by using DAX and Calculated Columns
5.Bookmarks, Selection, Switches (Active/Inactive Buttons), Actions, Page Navigations , Charts etc.
