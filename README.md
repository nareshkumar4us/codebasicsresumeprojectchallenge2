#Codebasicsresumeprojectchallenge2

As a data analyst,I have created a report by using POWER BI on Atliq Martâ€™s Supply Chain domain (FMCG) 
with input datasets and submitting this as part of Codebasics resume challenge for October 2022. 

Problem Statement:

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend the annual contract due to service issues. 
It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, 
which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities.

Worked on the following tasks,

1.Connecting to source and importing data into POWER BI
2.Data Modelling in Power BI
3.Data Preprocessing by using Power Query Editor
4.Creating Measures by using DAX and Calculated Columns
5.Bookmarks, Selection, Switches (Active/Inactive Buttons), Actions, Page Navigations 


Terminologies used:

IF% - In Full Delivery
OT% - On-Time Delivery
OTIF% - On Time In Full Delivery
LIFR% - Line Fill Rate
VOFR% - Volume Fill Rate
